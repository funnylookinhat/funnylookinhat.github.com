    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I&#8217;m trying to come up with a quick theme for a site that I&#8217;m building ( a one page or something of that sort ), I usually head over to <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">colorschemedesigner.com</a> and just start randomly throwing in something of the blue or green variety.</p>

<p>In particular, I&#8217;ve been digging <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/#2P41Tllo0w0w0http://colorschemedesigner.com/#2P41Tllo0w0w0">this colorset</a> quite a bit lately.  Our house has lots of bold natural colors, and from my place in the shame-corner of the web design world, I&#8217;d venture to guess that bold naturals are coming back - ergo, we are trendy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/posts/natural_colors.png"></p>

<p>Take special note of what I just said there: <em>I&#8217;d venture to guess</em> that bold naturals are coming back.  <strong>Emphasis added.</strong>  Because that&#8217;s what you should notice.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason we ( coders ) should preclude even our most grandiose thoughts on design with &#8220;venture to guess&#8221;: we had our chance and we blew it.  Need I remind you what the Internet looked like when programmers and <em>l337 h4ckers</em> had their way with things?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/posts/ugly_website.png"></p>

<p>Three important things to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>We all did this - not one of us isn&#8217;t guilty.</li>
<li>Shortly after clicking &#8220;OK&#8221; on that alert I managed to steal his code and totally hack his website.  He has yet to counter-hack me.</li>
<li>If you ever need an example of a bad website from the GeoCities / Angelfire days, just google &#8220;diablo guild [cool mythological word] [even better word]&#8221;.  For example &#8220;diablo guild angels fury&#8221; or &#8220;diablo guild shadows night&#8221;.  It goes without saying that I had two Diablo guilds back in the hey-day: Angels of Fury and Shadows of the Night.  We pwned.</li>
</ol>


<p>My point is this - the Internet was the most visually unappealing mish-mash of colors until the designers of the world rolled up their sleeves, learned what UX was, and started telling us what to do.  Designers have taught me to use one bold color, one accent color, and have my content be fairly monochromatic.</p>

<p>So - rather than use every single ( albeit amazing ) color in that natural color theme above - I&#8217;ve implemented it on this site by pulling in just two colors ( background and header sub-title ).  It&#8217;s taken a while, but I think I can finally trust myself with a very basic site design.</p>

<p>The most important thing I&#8217;ve learned in the last 5 or 6 years of web work is how to work well with designers.  It takes time!  You need to be able to collaborate, offer clear UX suggestions, try to run with their ideas when appropriate, and continually remind yourself of what the Internet was when you had your reign.</p>

<p>Designers. I, for one, am grateful for our new color overlords.</p>
