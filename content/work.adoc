title: "Places I've Worked"
---

Some visitors may find my employment history interesting. This list includes every job I've held all the way back to high school. *I've actually loved every job that I have had* (yes, even Best Buy).

* *Best Buy* - Retail Sales for Computers.
** I really enjoyed being able to sell customers exactly what they needed.
** Claim to fame: I'd have customers come and ask for me specifically based on referrals they had received.
*** When my manager asked why, customers said that "they heard David wouldn't force them to buy warranty extensions".
*** This didn't make my boss too happy - but it's hard to justify a $200 service plan on a $300 eMachines PC.

* *AirLogic* - Support and installation technician.
** AirLogic was a wireless ISP in the Chicagoland area.
** By working there I was able to convince the team to build the network out to include my house. This was my first experience with broadband internet!
** Website no longer exists, but this link:https://web.archive.org/web/20041204032339/http://airlogic.net/[Wayback Archive] is from when I worked there.

* *Re:sources IT* - Support specialist for user management.
** I took a semester off from university and worked in downtown Chicago.
** This was the "IT Company" for the North American link:https://www.publicisgroupe.com/en[Publicis Groupe] companies at the time.
** I don't think I have ever worked near as many good lunch spots as this job.
** I remember watching Zidane headbutt Materazzi from the office kitchen.
** After playing for only half of the season, I still managed to snag third place in the company poker league.

* *link:https://www.timber-lee.com/[Camp Timber-Lee]* - Camp counselor.
** I loved summer camp as a kid; being able to be a counselor was even more fun.
** Soundtrack to the summer: link:https://www.rockapella.com/[Rockapella].

* *link:https://bennigans.com/[Bennigan's]* - Server.
** Being a server at a restaurant is a great way to learn to manage a queue.
** Free french fries, potato soup, and chicken fingers? Sounds like a poor
   college student's dream job.
** I was somehow set up on a blind date with a customer's daughter (or neice?)
   once.
*** I thought I was giving this person a tour of the city - "Hey, welcome to
    Denver.  Here's a good spot to find a coffee shop.  There are great urban
    hikes near this area." etc.
*** It turns out she thought we were on a date (I was likely oblivious, so the
    error is on me), and to save face I took her to a restaurant with a nice
    wine list.
*** This is the evening I first found out what a nice wine list [.line-through]#was# cost.
*** It went about as well as most blind dates go (or so I've heard).

* *link:https://www.ccu.edu/[Colorado Christian University]* - Resident Assistant and Tutor.
** Overlaying map searches for "ski resort" and "university" is a great way to
   ensure you have plenty to do in between classes during the winter.
** I'd love to tutor or teach again; I was studying to become a Math teacher
   until the guiles of tech lured me away.

* *link:https://www.wellcomemat.com/[WellcomeMat]* - Lead Web Developer.
** I joined for a summer to write some code to rebuild the video players; they ended up convincing me to stay for a bit longer!
** I loved working for a startup in a garage!
** I lost count of exactly how many Chipotle burritos I ate in the 1.5 years I was there - but it was more than 100.
*** The proper Chipotle order:
**** Barbacoa Burrito. Black Beans. Brown Rice.
**** Every salsa. Extra corn salsa. No dairy.
**** Green Tobasco sauce drenched on every bite.

* *link:https://system76.com/[System76]* - Lead Web Developer.
** Hands down the best place a geek could work. Everything exuded nerdiness.
** Best commute I've ever had: riding my bike 2 miles downtown in morning traffic.
** Also best breakfast food: the burrito cart on 16th and Champa has the best green chili I've ever tasted!
** Getting to go to Ubuntu and Intel conferences every year I worked there was a blast!
** I'd love to cross paths with System76 again someday! (I moved on only because life was taking us away from Denver.)

* *link:http://moz.com/[Moz]* - Principal Engineer.
** This was my first experience working for what was essentially a silicon-valley-esque startup.
** Going for walks on nice days near the waterfront or Pike Place market was a great way to give my brain a rest.
** I've moved out of Seattle and still work for Moz as a full-time remote employee.
** Moz is likely the single best place I will ever work. The company cares deeply about its employees and what it stands for.
** My time at Moz has grown me as an engineer and a leader - and made me an overall better person (both in and out of work).
