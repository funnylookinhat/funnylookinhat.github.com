title: "Photos"

This is a collection of photos from travels, where we've lived, or simply
portraits.  I'm not even what I'd call an amateur photographer - these are all
just taken with my phone camera - but I've enjoyed collecting them and figured
others may appreciate them as well.

You can get a rough idea of the subject and location based on the filename.
If you're really curious about anything, you're always more than welcome to
reach out and ask!
