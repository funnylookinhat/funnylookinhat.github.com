Late last year I decided that I wanted to start a technical blog. That was the
primary reason which drove me to rebuild my website in https://gohugo.io/[Hugo].
It's been a really great project to get the year off to a quick start!

Hugo has certainly been a fun piece of software to dive into - it gives you a
fast feedback loop and is relatively straightforward.  My only real complaint
about Hugo is that it's become powerful enough that it's necessarilly complex.

Almost every "Quick Start" guide out there encourages you to pick a theme and
to just start writing content.  It's hard to find a guide to walk you through
the "how" of Hugo from the ground up; not even the official documentation had
anything readily available.

Thankfully, I found this post: https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/07/really-getting-started-hugo/[Really getting started with Hugo]

It gives a great "here are the basic building blocks" overview of a layout,
which is ultimately what most themes really turn out to be.

Ok that's enough for a demo blog post.

Test.
