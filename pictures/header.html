    <h1>Pictures</h1>

    <p>
      This is a collection of photos from travels, where we've lived, or simply portraits.  I'm not even what I'd call an amateur photographer - these are all just taken with my phone camera - but I've enjoyed collecting them and figured others may appreciate them as well.

      You can get a rough idea of the subject and location based on the filename.  If you're really curious about anything, you're always more than welcome to reach out and ask!
