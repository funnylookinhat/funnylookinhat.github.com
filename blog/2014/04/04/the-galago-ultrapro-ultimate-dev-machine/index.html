<div class="entry-content"><h3>( or &ndash; kicking it and taking names with the Galago )</h3>

<p>One of the benefits of working at <a href="https://www.system76.com">System76</a> is being able to work on a wide variety of hardware.  You tend to get a really good feel for what works and what doesn&rsquo;t with myriad of form factors and details.  For the last two and a half years, I primarily worked on an old model of the <a href="https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/gazelle">Gazelle Pro</a> (gazp6).  It was one of the last 15.6&#8221; models sold with a dedicated graphics card, and given that I am doing lots of WebGL development in my spare time, I wanted as many GPU cycles as possible so that I could develop around the hardware curve.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/galago-back.jpg" width="500"></p>

<h2>Paying Homage</h2>

<p>First, a couple of thoughts on the Gazelle.  While I&rsquo;m generally not a fan of 15.6&#8221; laptops ( they&rsquo;re simply too large for my personal taste ), this was one that I could appreciate.  The chiclet keyboard had fantastic travel.  The screen was bright and crisp, and the resolution was 1920x1080 &ndash; a detail that was hard to find in laptops at the time.  The dedicated nVidia graphics are still competitive ( 460GTX ) even today for laptops.  There wasn&rsquo;t a Steam game I couldn&rsquo;t play nor a WebGL demo I couldn&rsquo;t run simulataneously on 6 different windows, all the while seamlessly virtualizing OpenStack in a VirtualBox VM in the background.  It is an amazing laptop.</p>

<p>However, I recently bumped my development machine up to a <a href="https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galago">Galago UltraPro</a>.  I had been holding out for a Broadwell system ( i.e. one more year ) &ndash; thinking that it would finally manage to have the graphics capable of my projects and hobbies ( <em>cough</em> <strong>DOTA2</strong> <em>cough</em> ).  On a whim I was running some WebGL tests on the Galago using the 3.13 kernel with Mesa 10, and was suprised to find the Galago out-perform the dedicated graphics card of the Gazelle.  The decision at that point was pretty straightforward: go with the Galago.</p>

<p>I would maintain that &ndash; for the price &ndash; the Galago is the most unique offering currently on the market for laptops ( even more certainly if you consider the sub-market of Ubuntu laptops ).  This comes down to a few specific details &ndash; but the overwhelming three are the processor, graphics, and display.  Let&rsquo;s call this the triple-threat. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to call something that, never had the chance till now &ndash; bucket list: check.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/workflow-small.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>My workspace often looks something like this.  Notice the FPS on those demos?  boom! <a href="/images/posts/workflow.jpg">Fullsize</a></em></p>

<h2>UltraPro > UltraBook</h2>

<p>For lack of a better comparison, the UltraPro really needs to be measured with regards to UltraBooks.  The primary function of an UltraBook is to be portable and still fairly powerful, with an added emphasis on battery life.  The UltraPro was designed with these same two primary principles in mind, except that the processor is FAR more powerful than the class usually affords.</p>

<p>Most UltraBooks are built on U class processors &ndash; meaning that they have only two cores and use lower wattages ( i.e. less powerful ).  By and large, most other hardware vendors would rank an i7-4500U within their most powerful processor class ( more than likely based on the max clock speed for turbo-boost and the fact that it has the i7 instruction sets ).  The Galago, however, includes an i7-4750HQ.  This is a completely different class of processor &ndash; meant for performance over battery life.  That isn&rsquo;t to say that battery life is bad on the Galago ( I get an easy three hours ), but I&rsquo;d rather kick it and take names for three hours rather than do everything at half speed for six.</p>

<p>You can get a complete breakdown of what the 4750 has to offer <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/76087/Intel-Core-i7-4750HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_20-GHz">here</a> &ndash; but these are the features that really stick out to me:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Spec                  </th>
<th> i7-4500U                     </th>
<th> i7-4750HQ                      </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td># of Cores / Threads  </td>
<td> 2 / 4                        </td>
<td> 4 / 8                          </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cache                 </td>
<td> 4 MB                         </td>
<td> 6 MB                           </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max TDP               </td>
<td> 15 W                         </td>
<td> 47 W                           </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max Turbo Frequency   </td>
<td> 3.0 Ghz                      </td>
<td> 3.2 Ghz                        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max Memory Bandwidth  </td>
<td> 25.6 GB/s                    </td>
<td> 76.8 GB/s                      </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processor Graphics    </td>
<td> Intel HD Graphics 4400       </td>
<td> Intel Iris Pro Graphics 5200   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>When I look at that comparison, I see apples and oranges.  I know that they&rsquo;re both &ldquo;i7&rdquo; chips, but they&rsquo;re ultimately two completely different classes of processor.  I&rsquo;ve used the i7-4500U around the office in testing and whatnot, it&rsquo;s a good processor &ndash; however, the best way to compare it to the 4750HQ is this: anything I can do with the 4500U, I can also do with the 4750HQ, <strong>while simultaneously running a 4-node virtualized Openstack environment.</strong>  That is to say, invaluable performance considering my development workflow.</p>

<h2>Bloody Eyes are Sad Eyes</h2>

<p>The other HUGE difference between the two processors is the graphics.  I know I already mentioned that this was the straw that broke the back of my old laptop &ndash; but I can&rsquo;t stress enough how impressive Iris Pro 5200 is.  It flies &ndash; kicking OpenGL calls to the side of the road like a monster truck racing past llamas on it&rsquo;s way up a mountain.</p>

<p>Those graphics wouldn&rsquo;t look nearly as good on any other screen, the Galago&rsquo;s 14.1&#8221; IPS matte dispay is absolutely beautiful.  I mean &ndash; unbelievably good.  Most displays that ship today are overly washed out in an attempt to make them look brighter.  Pfft.  Pathetic.  The Galago doesn&rsquo;t compromise a fleeting glance of brightness for spot-on saturation; instead, it ships with a custom color profile to make sure the screen most accurately fits sRGB.  <a href="/images/posts/the-colors-duke.gif">THE COLORS DUKE. THE COLORS!</a></p>

<p>Nearly as important is the resolution &ndash; I think 1080p is just right on a 14.1&#8221; screen.  I can get plenty of lines of clear code in while not straining so much that my eyes start to bleed.  I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever had bloody eyes, but I&rsquo;m here to assure you it&rsquo;s not pleasant and should generally be avoided.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hacker-screen.gif" width="500"></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>Are you |337 like this h4x0r? Then you need a Galago to fit all those terminals.</em></p>

<h2>Hacker-Typer: Initialize</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of centered laptop keyboards.  I was a Thinkpad owner before I came to System76 and know the value of having well placed Del / Home / PgUp / PgDown / End keys if you write a lot of code.  The layout of this keyboard <em>just works</em> for me.  When the Galago first came out &ndash; it had a bad keyboard that failed to catch keystrokes; however, we admitted it and ended up replacing every single one we shipped with a brand new, completely re-engineered keyboard.  The typing feedback on the new keyboard is day-and-night different from the original &ndash; keys have a definitive click as you type, and once you get into the groove you just glide over them like some stereotypical hacker in a hollywood movie.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/galago-keyboard.jpg" width="500"></p>

<h2>Ubuntu-Powered</h2>

<p>It goes without saying, the Galago ships with Ubuntu Linux installed by default.  I&rsquo;m thoroughly convinced that Ubuntu is a far better platform to develop on than Windows or OS X.  My argument is far too thorough to shoe-horn in at this point; suffice it to say, I&rsquo;ve ( regrettably ) tried to make it work on both Windows and OS X in my past, and they both ultimately got in the way.  When I finally came running back to Linux like the prodigal son, I found it frustrating and difficult to get good hardware support out of the box on a variety of laptop hardware.  I ended up spending far too much time trying to configure some part of my system to work correctly &ndash; in reality I simply wanted a tool that worked.</p>

<p>Having an &ldquo;Ubuntu out of the box&rdquo; laptop solves that problem for me.  No config files.  No optimus hacks.  No kernel patches.  No firmware cutter.  Just pure &amp; powerful Ubuntu.  Upon receiving my laptop, I opened it up, and was getting down and dirty with my code within minutes.</p>

<p>As a quick side note &ndash; we take a bit of pride in the image that we preinstall on our computers.  We know that quite a few of our customers are developers, so we include a lot of commonly used tools by default to simply get you going faster.  Packages like curl, bazaar, git, and build-essential are all pre-installed.  We also do some common-sense tweaks to gedit, like changing the default tab size from 8 characters down to 4 &ndash; not that we expect you to write everything in gedit, but it sure doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<h2>QED</h2>

<p>The Galago UltraPro is the best development machine I&rsquo;ve ever written code on.  It&rsquo;s fast, light, and durable: it travels extremely well.  It feels completely comfortable to type on.  The clickpad is accurate and stays out of the way when you&rsquo;re typing.  The graphics are fast enough to frag on.  I can run plenty of virtual machines while simultaneously working &ndash; nothing skips a beat.  The screen is top-notch, with plenty of pixels for my code.  When push comes to shove, it gets me working faster, and without getting in my way.  <strong>I dare you to find me a better devtop.</strong></p>
