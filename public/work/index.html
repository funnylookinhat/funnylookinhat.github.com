<p>Some visitors may find my employment history interesting. This list includes every job I’ve held all the way back to high school. <strong>I’ve actually loved every job that I have had</strong> (yes, even Best Buy).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Buy</strong> - Retail Sales for Computers.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I really enjoyed being able to sell customers exactly what they needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim to fame: I’d have customers come and ask for me specifically based on referrals they had received.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When my manager asked why, customers said that &#34;they heard David wouldn’t force them to buy warranty extensions&#34;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This didn’t make my boss too happy - but it’s hard to justify a $200 service plan on a $300 eMachines PC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AirLogic</strong> - Support and installation technician.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>AirLogic was a wireless ISP in the Chicagoland area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By working there I was able to convince the team to build the network out to include my house. This was my first experience with broadband internet!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website no longer exists, but this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041204032339/http://airlogic.net/">Wayback Archive</a> is from when I worked there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re:sources IT</strong> - Support specialist for user management.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I took a semester off from university and worked in downtown Chicago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was the &#34;IT Company&#34; for the North American <a href="https://www.publicisgroupe.com/en">Publicis Groupe</a> companies at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think I have ever worked near as many good lunch spots as this job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching Zidane headbutt Materazzi from the office kitchen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After playing for only half of the season, I still managed to snag third place in the company poker league.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.timber-lee.com/">Camp Timber-Lee</a></strong> - Camp counselor.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I loved summer camp as a kid; being able to be a counselor was even more fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soundtrack to the summer: <a href="https://www.rockapella.com/">Rockapella</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://bennigans.com/">Bennigan’s</a></strong> - Server.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being a server at a restaurant is a great way to learn to manage a queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free french fries, potato soup, and chicken fingers? Sounds like a poor college student’s dream job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was somehow set up on a blind date with a customer’s daughter once - it didn’t go well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ccu.edu/">Colorado Christian University</a></strong> - Resident Assistant and Tutor.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overlaying map searches for &#34;ski resort&#34; and &#34;university&#34; are <strong>not</strong> a good way to find a school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d love to tutor or teach again; I was studying to become a Math teacher until the guiles of tech lured me away.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.wellcomemat.com/">WellcomeMat</a></strong> - Lead Web Developer.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I joined for a summer to write some code to rebuild the video players; they ended up convincing me to stay for a bit longer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved working for a startup in a garage!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost count of exactly how many Chipotle burritos I ate in the 1.5 years I was there - but it was more than 100.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The proper Chipotle order:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Barbacoa Burrito. Black Beans. Brown Rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every salsa. Extra corn salsa. No dairy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green Tobasco sauce drenched on every bite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a></strong> - Lead Web Developer.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hands down the best place a geek could work. Everything exuded nerdiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best commute I’ve ever had: riding my bike 2 miles downtown in morning traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also best breakfast food: the burrito cart on 16th and Champa has the best green chili I’ve ever tasted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting to go to Ubuntu and Intel conferences every year I worked there was a blast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d love to cross paths with System76 again someday! (I moved on only because life was taking us away from Denver.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://moz.com/">Moz</a></strong> - Principal Engineer.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This was my first experience working for what was essentially a silicon-valley-esque startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going for walks on nice days near the waterfront or Pike Place market was a great way to give my brain a rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve moved out of Seattle and still work for Moz as a full-time remote employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moz is likely the single best place I will ever work. The company cares deeply about its employees and what it stands for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My time at Moz has grown me as an engineer and a leader - and made me an overall better person (both in and out of work).</p>
