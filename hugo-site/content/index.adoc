== Hello!

[.greeting]
My name is David Overcash, and I live in Maine, USA. *o/*

This site is meant to be a brief introduction to myself and a collection of
links and documents that I find interesting.

=== Some things about myself

* I grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, USA.
** The greatest gift of living near Chicago is a love for food.
** Favorite Pizza: Chicago pub-style thin crust
** Favorite Burrito: El Famous Burrito
** Favorite Sandwich: Italian Beef (dipped!)
** I'm lucky enough to live near a chicago-style hotdog joint:
   https://g.co/kgs/V9GYNK4[Cormier's Dog House]
* I've lived in the following places: Chicago (IL), West Lafayette (IN,
  Purdue University), Denver (CO), Seattle (WA), Port Townsend (WA),
  Portland (ME).
* My partner and I have been together for 15+ years and have a son - Jasper.
* I am software developer by trade.
* I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy books.
* I used to work out of a barn, but we moved!
* I love to travel internationally.
** My most recent trip was to Japan in April of 2023.</li>
** All of the countries I've visited (in order of first visit) include:
   Jamaica, France, United Kingdom, Uganda, The Netherlands, Denmark,
  Sweden, Spain, Canada, Japan.
* I have an eclectic music taste (from minimal European compositions to
  Japanese Pop).
* My family and I recently moved from Port Hadlock, Washington to Portland,
  Maine, USA
** If you're ever in Portland, Maine - let me know and we can meet up!
** My goal for 2025 is to attend https://monktoberfest.com/[Monktoberfest]
   now that it's nearby!

=== Technical Stuff

[.technical-stuff]
* Lately I've been mostly writing code in *Node.js*; I keep looking for 
  opportunities to use *Golang* or *Rust*.
** I'm working on publishing a _"What I'm learning in YYYY"_ - a blog should
   be up before the end of January 2025 which will include a post to that 
   effect.
* I currently am running Pop OS (GNU/Linux) as my daily driver.</li>
* At our previous home in rural Washington, we worked with the local public
  utility district to build out fiber service to our house. It was
  a really fun technical project, and I'd be happy to share advice with
  anyone looking to do the same!

=== Projects

Here are a few things I've created in the past:

* https://github.com/funnylookinhat/vaultexec[Vaultexec] (Run applications
  with Vault secrets)
* https://interactive-world-demo.funnylookinhat.com[Virtual World Demo]
** A while ago I was experimenting with 3D environments delivered through a
   browser.  This was an attempt at seeing what current consumer-grade
   hardware could handle through a 3D canvas.
** Source can be found here:
   https://github.com/funnylookinhat/interactive-world-demo
* https://nodejs-world.funnylookinhat.com[Interactive Chat World]
** An iteration on experimentation from the same train of thought as the
   previous item.  This focused on creating a lightweight websocket server
   and 2D renderer so that users could move their avatars around a shared
   space and chat with each other.
* https://beansbooks.com[BeansBooks]
** An Open Source accounting platform I built while working at https://system76.com[System76].

** As in, Isaac Newton!  It took quite a bit of time searching through
   available Google Voice numbers to find a famous physicist, mathematician,
   or computer scientist who had a last name available in an area code that
   was local to where I lived at the time (Denver).

* [.line-through]#Keybase:# https://keybase.io/funnylookinhat
** I've mostly stopped using Keybase since its aquisition, but I keep it
   around just in case it's the only convenient method of communication for
   someone.
** I'll likely get rid of it completely once I stand up a Matrix server.
* IRC: FunnyLookinHat
** [.line-through]#Freenode#
*** I've stopped participating in Freenode network.
*** See
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode#Ownership_change_and_conflict[Freenode: Ownership change and conflict]
   for a history of why that network is no longer as popular as it
   used to be.
** https://libera.chat/[libera.chat]
*** #docker
*** #ubuntu
*** #solus
*** #node.js
*** #go-nuts
** [.line-through]#http://d00mnet.com/[d00mnet]#
*** Unfortunately, it appears this network is no longer operating.
*** I had some amazing friends through this network - we all came together
    in the #japan-a-radio channel as fans of J-Pop.
*** If you used to idle there and would be interested in re-creating
    the group from the #japan-a-radio channel, let me know.  I would be open
    to hosting an IRC server.
*** Coincidentally, the https://www.japanaradio.com/[Japan-A-Radio] station
    has ceased operating.  It's a shame - as they had an excellent selection
    of music and introduced me to a much wider array of J-Pop than I knew
    existed.
