    <h1>Places I've worked</h1>

    <p>
      Some visitors may find my employment history interesting.  This list
      includes every job I've held all of the way back to high school.
      <b>I've actually loved every job that that I have had</b> (yes, even Best Buy).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Best Buy</b> - Retail Sales for Computers.
        <ul>
          <li>I really enjoyed being able to sell customers exactly what they needed.</li>
          <li>Claim to fame: I'd have customers come and ask for me specifically based on referrals they had received.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>AirLogic</b> - Support and installation technician.
        <ul>
          <li>AirLogic was a wireless ISP in Chicagoland area.</li>
          <li>By working there I was able to convince the team to build the network out to include my house. This was my first experience with broadband internet!</li>
          <li>Website no longer exists, but this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041204032339/http://airlogic.net/">Wayback Archive</a> is from when I worked there.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Re:sources IT</b> - Support specialist for user management.
        <ul>
          <li>I took a semester off from university and worked in downtown Chicago.</li>
          <li>This was the "IT Company" for the North American <a href="https://www.publicisgroupe.com/en">Publicis Groupe</a> companies at the time.</li>
          <li>I don't think I have ever worked near as many good lunch spots as this job.</li>
          <li>I remember watching Zidane headbutt Materazzi from the office kitchen.</li>
          <li>After playing for only half of the season, I still managed to snag third place in the company poker league.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.timber-lee.com/">Camp Timber-Lee</a></b> - Camp counselor.
        <ul>
          <li>I loved summer camp as a kid; being able to be a counselor was even more fun.</li>
          <li>Soundtrack to the summer: <a href="https://www.rockapella.com/">Rockapella</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://bennigans.com/">Bennigan's</a></b> - Server
        <ul>
          <li>Being a server at a restaurant is a great way to learn to manage a queue.</li>
          <li>Free french fries, potato soup, and chicken fingers? Sounds like a poor college student's dream job.</li>
          <li>I was somehow setup on a blind date with a customer's daughter once - it didn't go well.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.ccu.edu/">Colorado Christian University</a></b> - Resident Assistant and Tutor
        <ul>
          <li>Overlaying map searches for "ski resort" and "university" are <b>not</b> a good way to find a school.</li>
          <li>I'd love to tutor or teach again; I was studying to become a Math teacher until the guiles of tech lured me away.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.wellcomemat.com/">WellcomeMat</a></b> - Lead Web Developer
        <ul>
          <li>I joined for a summer to write some code to rebuild the video players; they ended up convincing me to stay for a bit longer!</li>
          <li>I loved working for a startup in a garage!</li>
          <li>I lost count of exactly how many Chipotle burritos I ate in the 1.5 years I was there - but it was more than 100.
            <ul>
              <li>The proper Chipotle order:</li>
              <li>Barbacoa Burrito. Black Beans. Brown Rice.</li>
              <li>Every salsa. Extra corn salsa. No dairy.</li>
              <li>Green Tobasco sauce drenched on every bite.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a></b> - Lead Web Developer
        <ul>
          <li>Hands down the best place a geek could work.  Everything exuded nerdiness.</li>
          <li>Best commute I've ever had: riding my bike 2 miles downtown in morning traffic.</li>
          <li>Also best breakfast food: the burrito cart on 16th and Champa has the best green chili I've ever tasted!</li>
          <li>Getting to go to Ubuntu and Intel conferences every year I worked there was a blast!</li>
          <li>I'd love to cross paths with System76 again some day! (I moved on only because life was taking us away from Denver.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="http://moz.com/">Moz</a></b> (aka SEOMoz) - Software Engineer
        <ul>
          <li>This was my first experience working for what was essentially a silicon-valley-esque startup.</li>
          <li>Going for walks on nice days near the waterfront or Pike Place market was a great way to give my brain a rest.</li>
          <li>I've moved out of Seattle and still work for Moz as a full-time remote employee.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
